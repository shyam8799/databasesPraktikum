How to run:

Download Maven, make sure that it is installed.

Just go to the project folder and run:

mvn tomcat7:run

The project should be visible under

localhost:8080/FestivalApp

the current controller takes values after the URI segment FestivalApp/ARGUMENT

so take a look at how it works please.

Remarks:

We are using the spring Framework which is extremely easy and intuitive, just needs the user to know Java, please go through this short and 
comprehensible tutorial and take a look at what has already been developed.

And mostly just take a look at the code.
